# Welcome to the Data Wonderland 🚀

# Data Engineer in Action

Hey there! 👋 I'm Sree Shanthan, a proud data engineer navigating the data universe one byte at a time. They say data is the new oil, but let's face it – sometimes it feels more like the new spaghetti. 🍝

## About Me

- 🧠 **Data Maestro**: Turning raw data into actionable insights. If data were a canvas, I'd be the Picasso with a keyboard.
  
- 💻 **Code Sorcerer**: Fluent in Python, SQL, and the ancient art of turning coffee into code.

- 🚀 **ETL Astronaut**: Extracting, Transforming, and Loading data like it's nobody's business. Because who doesn't love a good data rocket launch?

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Data Detective**: Solving mysteries in datasets. If Sherlock Holmes were a coder, he'd probably be a data engineer.

## Fun Facts

- My code is so clean it makes detergent jealous.
- I speak SQL better than my mother tongue.
- I don't always test my code, but when I do, it's in production.

## Current Mission

Exploring new galaxies of data, one API at a time. If you have a dataset that needs rescuing, I'm your data superhero! 💾

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss data, share a coding joke, or debate whether tabs or spaces are superior. Spoiler: It's tabs. 😉

Happy coding! 🚀
